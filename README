tex4ht

Environment for local corrections of tex4ht tools

Repository structure:

    Designed to keep in synchro with original sources from
        http://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/tex4ht.zip

    Sources split to separate project directories for each tool tex4ht, t4ht and htcmd respectively.

Building:

    Inside of TeX Live (TL) building tree:
        - mount current TL repository version to some local path:
            svn co svn://username:password@tug.org/texlive/trunk
        - overwrite original TL source file
                trunk/Build/source/texk/tex4htk/tex4ht.c
            with modifyed one from this repository
                tex4ht/tex4ht.c
        - copy script
                Build_tex4ht.sh
            to TL tree subdirectory
                trunk/Build/source
        - execute it:
                cd <...>/trunk/Build/source
                ./Build_tex4ht.sh
            resulting binary executable is created here:
                trunk/Build/source/Work/texk/tex4htk/tex4ht

    Using Automake:
        tex4ht binary could be built under GNU Automake using shell script tex4ht/build.sh
            cd tex4ht
            ./build.sh
        For use of the GNU Automake environment under MS Windows following tools should be additionally installed:
            MinGW gcc compiler:
                https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/latest/download?source=files
                    Be careful -- Bitdefender antivirus complains about MinGW v.7.1.0 build 4.3.0 distribution package of 05.03.2017 --
                        files mingw32\opt\bin\python*.exe and mingw32\bin\gdb.exe are recognized as infected by malware Gen:Variant.Razy.191694
                        Be prepared to delete these files or use another MinGW distribution, v.5.1.0 for instance:
                                https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/files/latest/download?source=rw_typ_t5
                            (not tested yet)
                    Path of installed bianries
                            %ProgramFiles%\mingw-w64\i686-7.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v5-rev0\mingw32\bin
                        should be added to environment variable PATH
            MSYS POSIX shell environment:
                https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/MSYS%20%2832-bit%29/MSYS-20111123.zip/download
            GNU Autoconf / Automake:
                http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/automake.htm
                http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/autoconf.htm
                http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/m4.htm

Add-ons to module tex4ht:

    Following are attempts to deal with the problem, that original heuristic recognition of spaces in tex4ht doesn't work correctly enough --
        there are situations, when spaces disappear or are duplicated.

        command line switch -n
            totally cuts off the heuristic algorithm for recognition of spaces in .dvi file;
            spaces then should be generated using some explicit means, for example by inserting commands
                \special{t4ht=\&\#32;} into the source .tex file.

        command line switch -r
            correction of spaces recognition threshold;
            the percentage of the initial threshold value should be provided:
                -r100   no change, the algorithm operates as usual;
                -r50    threshold of spaces generation is increased twice -- resulting amount of spaces decreases;
                -r200   threshold decreased by half, more spaces.

TODO:

Synchronize with source repository at
    http://svn.gnu.org.ua/sources/tex4ht/trunk

Command line switch -r currently does work in math mode solely.
